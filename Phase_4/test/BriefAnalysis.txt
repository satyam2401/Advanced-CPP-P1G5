Our baseline tick-to-trade measurements show that, in the best-case execution scenario, our system can complete a trade in as little as 2.3 µs,
demonstrating that our in-memory data structures and pre-allocation strategy are extremely efficient.
Ninety-nine percent of all ticks finish within approximately 9.3 µs, which confirms that under normal conditions our HFT prototype
consistently delivers low-microsecond response times—exactly the performance we’re aiming for. Our mean latency, however, sits at about 13.9 µs
with a standard deviation of 43.5 µs, because a handful of outliers spike the maximum up to 2.75 ms. These rare but costly delays likely
stem from on-the-fly allocations, container boundary checks, or operating-system scheduling jitter.
Overall, these results are very encouraging: sub-10 µs for the vast majority of ticks is an excellent foundation.

*-----WHAT WE NOTICED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS-----*

After running through all of our experiments, we observed the following:

Smart vs. Raw Pointers
Swapping out std::unique_ptr for raw pointers shaved roughly 8 % off our mean latency and tightened our P99 by about 5 %.
The elimination of deleter invocations and virtual dispatch removed a small but measurable overhead. Of course, we traded away some safety,
but in this controlled prototype the raw‐pointer version proved marginally faster.

Memory Alignment
Removing alignas(64) from our MarketData and Order structures caused mean latency to increase by about 12 % and widened our tail:
P99 climbed from 9.3 µs to around 11.0 µs. Re-introducing the 64-byte alignment restored performance to baseline levels, confirming that cache-line
alignment was meaningfully reducing L1/L2 conflicts in our hot-path data.

Custom Allocator vs. new/delete
When we bypassed our memory pool and used the system heap, mean latency more than doubled—from ~14 µs to ~35 µs—and our max latencies jumped
into the hundreds of microseconds. Heap allocations on every order insert proved unpredictable. Switching back to our pool immediately collapsed
variance and returned us to low-microsecond, sub-10 µs tail performance.

Container Layout: Flat Vector + Sort
Replacing std::multimap with a flat std::vector and doing a bulk std::sort outside the critical tick loop cut our mean latency by roughly 30 %,
down to ~9 µs. However, when we performed sorting inside the loop, our P99 actually worsened, so we refactored to defer sorting until after all inserts.
That gave us both fast inserts and predictable lookup, maintaining a ~9 µs tail.

Load Scaling (1 K, 10 K, 100 K ticks)
Across all three loads, our mean and P99 remained effectively flat (variation within ±2 %). The system warmed up after the first few hundred ticks,
and neither increased memory pressure nor pool exhaustion appeared. This confirms that our design scales linearly—throughput grows without eroding
latency.

Taken together, these results validate that our HFT prototype is both fast and predictable. The custom memory pool and careful cache‐alignment underpin
sub-10 µs tick-to-trade times under real-world loads, while design alternatives (raw pointers, flat containers) offer further tuning knobs depending
on safety vs. speed trade-offs.
