Trade Processing System Implementation
This project implements a multi-threaded trade processing system with a focus on concurrent programming techniques in C++. The system demonstrates advanced C++ concurrency features including atomic operations, memory ordering, and modern synchronization primitives.
System Architecture
The implementation consists of the following key components:

Lock-free Concurrent Queue (ConcurrentQueue.hpp)

Uses atomic operations with various memory ordering semantics
Efficiently handles producer-consumer pattern without locks
Implements a ring buffer with atomic head and tail indices


Order Processing (OrderProcessing.cpp)

Defines the core data structures for orders and the order book
Implements producer and consumer thread functions
Uses shared mutex for reader-writer access to the order book


Analytics (Analytics.cpp)

Performs parallel analysis on processed orders
Uses C++17 parallel algorithms for performance
Calculates various metrics like latency statistics


Benchmarking (Benchmarks.hpp)

Provides utilities for timing and performance measurement
Collects and reports benchmark results


Main Application (main.cpp)

Coordinates the overall system execution
Creates and manages producer and consumer threads
Reports performance metrics and results



Implementation Details
Memory Ordering
The implementation demonstrates different memory ordering semantics:

std::memory_order_relaxed: Used for simple counter updates where ordering isn't critical
std::memory_order_acquire: Used when reading queue state to ensure all prior writes are visible
std::memory_order_release: Used when publishing writes that must be visible to other threads
std::atomic_thread_fence: Used as explicit barriers for ordering operations across multiple variables

Synchronization Primitives
The system showcases modern C++ synchronization features:

std::shared_mutex: Allows multiple readers but exclusive writers for the order book
std::latch: Ensures all threads start processing simultaneously
std::barrier: Synchronizes consumer threads at specific points
std::counting_semaphore: Limits the number of orders processed concurrently

Parallel Algorithms
The analytics component demonstrates C++17 parallel algorithms:

std::reduce with std::execution::par for parallel reduction
std::transform_reduce for parallel mapping and reduction
std::minmax_element for parallel finding of extrema

Building and Running
Compile with a C++20 compatible compiler:
bashg++ -std=c++20 -pthread main.cpp OrderProcessing.cpp Analytics.cpp -o trading_system
Run the executable:
bash./trading_system

Performance Considerations

The lock-free queue eliminates contention points between producers and consumers
Different memory orderings allow for performance optimization without sacrificing correctness
The shared mutex allows multiple readers to access the order book concurrently
The barrier and latch ensure proper synchronization at critical points
